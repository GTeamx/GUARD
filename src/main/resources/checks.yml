#Guard AntiCheat 'checks.yml' configuration file.
#Quick presentation and explanations, for any help please contact our Support on Discord.

#This is an example and does not represent an actual check:

Check A: #Check = Check name | A = Check type. | WARNING: CHANGING THIS WILL BREAK THE CHECK AND THE CONFIG.
  enabled: false #Must be a BOOLEAN (True/False) | Toggles the check's activity.
  silent: true #Must be a BOOLEAN (True/Flase) | Toggles the check's setback.
  Buffer:
    addBuffer: 0 #Must be a NUMBER (0, 1, 1.5, 2...) | How many is added to the 'buffer' when the check is triggered, prevents false positives.
    maxBuffer: 0 #Must be a NUMBER (0, 1, 1.5, 2...) | Buffer limit before actually sending an alert.
    removeBuffer: 0 #Must be a NUMBER (0, 1, 1.5, 2...) | How many is removed from the 'buffer' when the player isn't triggering the check.
  Punishments:
    kick: false #Must be a BOOLEAN (True/False) | Toggles if the check is allowed to kick the player.
    ban: false #Must be a BOOLEAN (True/False) | Toggles if the check is allowed to ban a player.
    punishVL: 0 #Must be a NUMBER (0, 1, 2, 3...) | How many alerts are required before triggering the auto punishments system.
  Messages:
    kickMessage: "%GUARD PREFIX% §cYou were kicked for Unfair Advantage." #Must be a TEXT ("Bla bla bla") | Message showed to kicked players.
    banMessage: "%GUARD PREFIX% §cYou were banned for Unfair Advantage." #Must be a TEXT ("Bla bla bla") | Message showed to banned players.
    broadcastPunish: false #Must be a BOOLEAN (True/False) | Toggles if a broadcast is made when a player gets punished.
    broadcastMessage: "%GUARD PREFIX% §c%player% §fhas been removed for §cUnfair Advantage." #Must be a TEXT ("Bla bla bla") | Message showed in the broadcast when a player is punished.

#If you have any troubles or difficulties when configuring the checks, contact our Support on our Discord server.
#End of example.
